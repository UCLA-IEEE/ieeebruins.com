## Setting up a Local PHP Server with MAMP
The tool that I use to set up a local PHP server is called MAMP.  
You can download it here: [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)  
No, you do not have to download MAMP Pro. Just download MAMP.  
Basically you can download it, and run it. Within MAMP's settings, you can
choose which folder MAMP serves files from.  
Once you're started up MAMP and have it pointed to the correct project
directory, you can visit `localhost:8000` or something and view the website.
