          <h2>IEEE Worldwide Organization</h2>
          <p>
            The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the
            primary professional society of the electrical engineering
            profession. It has more than 330,000 members worldwide; including
            52,000 student members. It publishes more than 40 technical journals
            and sponsors or co-sponsors more than 1,000 scientific conferences
            and meetings around computer engineering, computer science, and
            related fields. The IEEE has a student branch in every major
            university in curriculum. Getting involved with the IEEE worldwide
            organization is highly encouraged, and can provide you with many
            resources to jump-start an engineering career and expand your
            network.

          <h2>General Member</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most common questions we receive is how can one become a
            member of our club. We don't have tight restrictions on who is and
            who isn't a member. Becoming a general member of our club is as
            simple as getting involved with one of our project curriculums,
            participating in any of our annual workshop series, showing up to a
            social or two, joining our Facebook page, or even just sitting in
            the lab just to say hi to your favorite officers. <br /><br />
            Whichever you choose to do to get more involved, we'll be more than
            happy to welcome you to the club!

          <h2>General Board</h2>
          <p>
            General Board is our annual mentorship program. Every year, members
            of our officer board choose to lead a group of 3-5 general members
            for the rest of the academic year. Each GB decides on a a set of
            focuses for their group, chosen among technical projects, hosting
            socials and events, or professional development. In addition,
            members of a GB get first-hand experience in what it's like to be an
            officer for this organization, which usually motivates higher club
            involvement in the future. <br /><br />
            General Board is a great way to experience a closer and more
            personal experience with us! Applications and info sessions happen a
            couple weeks before heading off for Winter break, so keep an eye out
            for those on our
