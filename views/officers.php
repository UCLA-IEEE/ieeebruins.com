            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> I found in IEEE something I had never been a part of before: a community of intellectuals who share a deep love of science and technology, and who each have a unique combination of interests, hobbies, personality, and character. UCLA IEEE is a point of convergence uniting all of us in the development of ourselves and each other, and the synergy and efficiency with which we solve problems together is a true thing of beauty. I see the lab and the people that populate it as my home and my family. I love the warmth, comraderie, and can-do attitude suffused into the air of the place. Though I was initially attracted to the technical aspects of participation in IEEE, I have since discovered all of the social and professional benefits of affiliation with my peers here. TL;DR: IEEE is great. Come hang out with us!</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> IEEE is the one thing that changed my life completely at UCLA. I initially joined because of NATCAR, which resembled a self-driving electric car. This experience inspired me to pursue more projects, but I realized IEEE is more than just about projects: these are great people who do great work, together. IEEE is an inclusive community where anyone can try something new, learn, collaborate, become more professional, develop friendships, and hangout. The Lab is our home, the people is our family, and we are all united by our passion in engineering and technology. IEEE made me the person I am today, which is why I am giving back so that IEEE can be one of YOUR best experiences.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> I appreciate IEEE because it has really helped me when I first started EE. I didn’t really know much about the major, but the people in the lab were welcoming, willing to help and giving advice. Not only that, it offers a space where one can come study or just hang out. The community that IEEE at UCLA has is beneficial as everyone works together to build themselves as well as each other, through both the projects and networking.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> When my academic advisor told me to join IEEE in the beginning of my freshman fall quarter, I had no idea how big a part of my college experience IEEE would become. Coming to UCLA with no hardware or software experience (Canada isn’t super techy), I learned so much through OPS and just by interacting with the IEEE members in general. Moreover, everyone in the club is extremely welcoming and willing to give advice, which I found really beneficial during my first year. Without a doubt, I believe that the best part of IEEE is the people, and I’ve met some of my closest friends at UCLA through IEEE.</p>

The community at IEEE is second to none; it’s full of incredibly smart and helpful people. It can be hard to find other electrical engineers at such a large school and IEEE is an organization where I can find friends and like-minded peers.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> Not only is IEEE a great place to learn and grow as a student, but it is also a second home. Going from an undergraduate class of 6000 to a smaller group of 200 bright, motivated, and intelligent super-humans (that’s not an exaggeration), it’s much easier to find your niche in the engineering community. The connections you make within the club internally, and professionally, are rare to make in any other organization on campus and the amount of hands-on experience and knowledge is astounding. Overall, I couldn’t thank IEEE enough for the opportunities it has given me and the home its provided me this past year and the years to come.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> I went into UCLA with minimal knowledge of Electrical Engineering. Now, although no where close to expert, these two words that are my major are starting to make more sense, which IEEE played a big role in. The organization has been the link connecting me to numerous areas outside of school academics. It has brought me new friends, assistance when needed, a place to apply my newfound knowledge, an opportunity to lead and give back, and, most importantly, confidence. By being an integral member of IEEE at UCLA, I have a community that supports one another, which allows me to be confident wherever I go.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> Its not just the name, ranking, and curriculum that make UCLA a great place, but also the amazing student groups found on campus. IEEE is a collection of some of the smartest and most motivated students on campus and thats exactly the kind of environment that you want be in to maximize your time here at UCLA. There’s an old saying that if you’re the smartest person in the room, then you’re probably in the wrong room, and IEEE to me is a place where I can continue to meet others who can teach me and make me into a more accomplished person.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> I probably couldn’t tell you what an electrical engineer did when I first joined IEEE during my freshman year. Someone suggested this club to me and I never looked back. It has taught me how to apply the seemingless endless and intricate concepts and formulas that the professors write on the board and I got to build really cool projects along the way. Also, the people in the lab are so supportive and incredibly smart and will help you with almost everything (even your homework :D). I am glad I could be a part of UCLA IEEE and I hope I can extend the same experience to other aspiring EE’s.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> Coming into UCLA as a first year, I was unsure of my major and alone in an unfamiliar enviroment. However, joining IEEE through OPS helped change both of these things. Through a project-driven agenda and the help from motivated peers, I was able to explore both the CS and EE fields and reassure my aspirations as an computer engineer. More than just a source of technical enrichment, IEEE is a family to me, with our home at the lab and members supporting each other. From late nights fighting with pool noodles to complaining about the unintuitive Arduino IDE, I can’t imagine UCLA with IEEE.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> The first year of college can be stressful to anyone. There’s a new environment, new people, and a new way of life. While I was being overwhelmed with everything going on around me, IEEE was a nice place where I found I could relax in the college experience. From C3 Coding Hangouts and making friends in the lab, IEEE became my place where I could take a break from classes and pursue my passion for coding.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> UCLA IEEE offers something that very few (if any) other clubs can offer. Not only does IEEE offer an equiped workspace to work on both IEEE projects and personal electronic projects, but it is also a community of people that share a common interest for electronics and electrical engineering. Being part of IEEE has made a large school like UCLA feel very personal and welcoming and gives students the ability to utilize theoretical knowledge learned in classes in engaging, hands-on projects.</p>

Creativity starts flowing, new ideas are formed, gaps in knowledge are filled, and everyone comes out of it knowing more than they came in with. The number of incredible projects that come out this club’s programs, and the number of people who learn valuable engineering skills through them is enough to make me realize how great this club is, and that’s not even counting the great friendly atmosphere that turns these projects into experiences that help build friendships and makes the work we do fun.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> IEEE is a family. The lab offers a unique place to meet others, work with others, and even struggle through the difficult classes with others. Each day I am allowed and encourged to challenge myself both personally and techincally. There is always another person who has a larger network or more technical skils. Each day, I can learn a new profesional skill or solve a difficult circuit problem. Everyone within IEEE loves to share knowledge.</p>

            <p><b>What I Like Most About IEEE:</b> After my first year as a member of IEEE, I began to see the similarities between it and the Hyperbolic Time Chamber from Dragonball Z – as long as you’re willing to put in the time, you’ll come out much stronger than before. The time I’ve spent cranking out OPS projects and working with my General Board have pushed me to reach heights I’ve never imagined. UCLA IEEE has always been my place to go to whenever I wanted to develop my skills, explore new areas of interest, or just bask in the comradery that eminates within the lab. I can always count on the people within this club to bring a smile on my face.</p>
