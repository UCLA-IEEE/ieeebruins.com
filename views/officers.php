In my spare time, I love to draw, bake, and suffer through the trials and tribulations of the Daily Crosswords.

Primarily, I'm interested in digital design (digital design is my passion), but I've done quite a bit of software work through my internships. This year, I'm a DAV lead, which means that I'm a fan of Verilog and decoding mysterious timing violations. Outside of school, I enjoy playing a ton of Mario Kart and Breath of the Wild and playing the New York Times crossword religiously. If you're interested in chip design/digital design, how I coded in Typescript for the entire summer, or how to tame the Lord of the Mountain (BOTW moment) then feel free to reach out!",
