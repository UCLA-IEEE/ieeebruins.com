        The goal of Outreach is to support the engineering communities around us
        through our various activities and programs such as our OPS 2.0 program,
        community college workshop series, or helping out with various local
        community events.

        Want to get in contact with us? If you are a UCLA student interested in
        joining the Outreach Committee or an outside organization inquiring
        about a potential collaboration please contact the Outreach Coordinators

              OPS 2.0 is a program dedicated to teaching IEEE student branches
              how to run their own beginner-friendly technical project. Starting
              in 2010, the Open Project Space (OPS) was founded by Leo Szeto at
              UCLA with the intention of providing hands-on projects to solidify
              the knowledge developed through ECE coursework. The OPS program is
              designed to teach Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts to
              fledgling engineers through hardware and software lectures,
              worksessions and projects. Taking this to the next level, the OPS
              2.0 program is designed to “teach the teacher” and onboard the OPS
              program at any university focused on developing technical
              experience for their members! Interested?

            <p>
              This year, we are working with El Camino and Cerritos College to
              organize technical workshops that teach the basics of electrical
              engineering and design. Our main goal with these workshops is to
              help prepare these students with the practical skills necessary to
              succeed as they continue on into their engineering journeys.
            </p>

              If you are interested in learning more about these workshops, feel
              free to contact us at the email provided above.

              Another goal of the Outreach Committee is to inspire the young
              engineers in the surrounding communities and show the many places
              you can go within STEM. We love to be able to attend different
              events in various communities to help spread the word about
              engineering. Some different events that we have attended before
              include running booths at school STEM fairs, judging and providing
              technical assistance for hackathons, and hosting workshops at
              surrounding schools. If you would like to get into contact with
