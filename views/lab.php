        <h1>THE IEEE <span class='ieee-blue'>LAB</span></h1>
        <p class='details'>
            With access to our lab and UCLA's campus as a whole being restricted
            due to COVID-19, <b>we're now using our
                <a href="https://discord.gg/yTR6XUS" target="_blank">Discord server</a>
                as our replacement for the physical lab.</b> We encourage you to use it
            just like you'd use our regular lab: meet new people, get help with
            projects, talk to officers, or just chill! We like to think of it as
            a home away from home away from home. The officers will be holding
            their lab hours on the Discord, so feel free to stop by and see
            who's there!
            <br><br>
            Although we'll primarily be using the Discord as our lab, our physical
            lab will be available on a case-by-case basis for those on campus who
            would like to use our tools. Please contact our Project and Lab
            Managers, Caleb and Chester, on the Slack or Discord for more information.
            <br><br>
            Our lab is located at <b>Boelter 2825</b>. The easiest way to find
            it is to go to the west side of 2nd floor Boelter (the lowest balcony).
            We are the second door down from the bridge to E-IV. The IEEE logo
            is posted on our door for easy locating.

                    We've stocked up on various tools that members can use in our labs.
                    <br /><br /> Some of the heavier tools we have include: soldering stations, oscilloscops, power supplies, 3D printers, a drill press, DMM's, a big whiteboard, etc. Mostly popular tools used to complete hardware related projects.
                    <br /><br /> We also have smaller, general tools such as: scissors, wire cutters, pliers, rulers, screwdrivers, etc.
