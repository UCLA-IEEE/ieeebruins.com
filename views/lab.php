        <h1>THE IEEE <span class='ieee-blue'>LAB</span></h1>
        <p class='details'>
            Here at UCLA, we've been given a lab space that we use as our center
            of operations. The IEEE Lab is an open space for all general members
            to come in, work on their projects, meet new people, talk to present
            officers, or even just to chill and eat lunch.
            <br><br>
            Although we'll primarily be using our physical lab, our
            <a href="https://discord.gg/yTR6XUS" target="_blank">Discord server</a>
            is still operating as a virtual lab. Feel free to join the lab voice
            channel. Officers will be monitoring it during their lab hours.
            <br><br>
            Our lab is located at <b>Boelter 2825</b>. The easiest way to find
            it is to go to the west side of 2nd floor Boelter (the lowest balcony).
            We are the second door down from the bridge to E-IV. The IEEE logo
            is posted on our door for easy locating.

                <p class='black'>
                    We've stocked up on various tools that members can use in our labs.
                    <br /><br /> Some of the heavier tools we have include: soldering stations, oscilloscopes, power supplies, 3D printers, a drill press, DMM's, a big whiteboard, etc. Mostly popular tools used to complete hardware related projects.
                    <br /><br /> We also have smaller, general tools such as: scissors, wire cutters, pliers, rulers, screwdrivers, etc.

                    Originally started to be a virtual lab during the COVID-19
                    pandemic, our Discord server remains the online hub for
                    connecting with IEEE. Join our Discord with this link:
